# --- Day 18: Snailfish ---

# You descend into the ocean trench and encounter some snailfish. They say they
# saw the sleigh keys! They'll even tell you which direction the keys went if
# you help one of the smaller snailfish with his math homework.

# Snailfish numbers aren't like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number
# is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be
# either a regular number or another pair.

# Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair.
# Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

# [1,2]
# [[1,2],3]
# [9,[8,7]]
# [[1,9],[8,5]]
# [[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
# [[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
# [[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]

# This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form
# a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For
# example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

# There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the
# process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that
# need to be reduced.

# To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this
# list that applies to the snailfish number:

#     If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
#     If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.

# Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

# During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns
# to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that
# meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

# To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number
# to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is
# added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any).
# Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire
# exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

# Here are some examples of a single explode action:

#     [[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular
#     number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).

#     [7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular
#     number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).

#     [[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].

#     [[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes
#     [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because
#     the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next
#     action).

#     [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].

# To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the
# pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the
# right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and
# rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6],
# and so on.

# Here is the process of finding the reduced result of
# [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

# after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
# after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
# after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
# after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
# after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
# after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]

# Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual
# result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

# The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your
# puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add
# the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third,
# then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list
# have been used once.

# For example, the final sum of this list is [[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]]:

# [1,1]
# [2,2]
# [3,3]
# [4,4]

# The final sum of this list is [[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]]:

# [1,1]
# [2,2]
# [3,3]
# [4,4]
# [5,5]

# The final sum of this list is [[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]]:

# [1,1]
# [2,2]
# [3,3]
# [4,4]
# [5,5]
# [6,6]

# Here's a slightly larger example:

# [[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
# [7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
# [[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
# [[[[2,4],7],[6,[0,5]]],[[[6,8],[2,8]],[[2,1],[4,5]]]]
# [7,[5,[[3,8],[1,4]]]]
# [[2,[2,2]],[8,[8,1]]]
# [2,9]
# [1,[[[9,3],9],[[9,0],[0,7]]]]
# [[[5,[7,4]],7],1]
# [[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]

# The final sum [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] is found
# after adding up the above snailfish numbers:

#   [[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
# + [7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
# = [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]

#   [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]
# + [[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
# = [[[[6,7],[6,7]],[[7,7],[0,7]]],[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,8],[8,0]]]]

#   [[[[6,7],[6,7]],[[7,7],[0,7]]],[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,8],[8,0]]]]
# + [[[[2,4],7],[6,[0,5]]],[[[6,8],[2,8]],[[2,1],[4,5]]]]
# = [[[[7,0],[7,7]],[[7,7],[7,8]]],[[[7,7],[8,8]],[[7,7],[8,7]]]]

#   [[[[7,0],[7,7]],[[7,7],[7,8]]],[[[7,7],[8,8]],[[7,7],[8,7]]]]
# + [7,[5,[[3,8],[1,4]]]]
# = [[[[7,7],[7,8]],[[9,5],[8,7]]],[[[6,8],[0,8]],[[9,9],[9,0]]]]

#   [[[[7,7],[7,8]],[[9,5],[8,7]]],[[[6,8],[0,8]],[[9,9],[9,0]]]]
# + [[2,[2,2]],[8,[8,1]]]
# = [[[[6,6],[6,6]],[[6,0],[6,7]]],[[[7,7],[8,9]],[8,[8,1]]]]

#   [[[[6,6],[6,6]],[[6,0],[6,7]]],[[[7,7],[8,9]],[8,[8,1]]]]
# + [2,9]
# = [[[[6,6],[7,7]],[[0,7],[7,7]]],[[[5,5],[5,6]],9]]

#   [[[[6,6],[7,7]],[[0,7],[7,7]]],[[[5,5],[5,6]],9]]
# + [1,[[[9,3],9],[[9,0],[0,7]]]]
# = [[[[7,8],[6,7]],[[6,8],[0,8]]],[[[7,7],[5,0]],[[5,5],[5,6]]]]

#   [[[[7,8],[6,7]],[[6,8],[0,8]]],[[[7,7],[5,0]],[[5,5],[5,6]]]]
# + [[[5,[7,4]],7],1]
# = [[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[8,7],[8,7]]],[[[7,0],[7,7]],9]]

#   [[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[8,7],[8,7]]],[[[7,0],[7,7]],9]]
# + [[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]
# = [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]]

# To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the
# magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude
# of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The
# magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

# For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9]
# is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of
# [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

# Here are a few more magnitude examples:

#     [[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
#     [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
#     [[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]] becomes 445.
#     [[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]] becomes 791.
#     [[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]] becomes 1137.
#     [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] becomes 3488.

# So, given this example homework assignment:

# [[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
# [[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]
# [6,[[[6,2],[5,6]],[[7,6],[4,7]]]]
# [[[6,[0,7]],[0,9]],[4,[9,[9,0]]]]
# [[[7,[6,4]],[3,[1,3]]],[[[5,5],1],9]]
# [[6,[[7,3],[3,2]]],[[[3,8],[5,7]],4]]
# [[[[5,4],[7,7]],8],[[8,3],8]]
# [[9,3],[[9,9],[6,[4,9]]]]
# [[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
# [[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]

# The final sum is:

# [[[[6,6],[7,6]],[[7,7],[7,0]]],[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[7,8],[9,9]]]]

# The magnitude of this final sum is 4140.

# Add up all of the snailfish numbers from the homework assignment in the order
# they appear. What is the magnitude of the final sum?

# --- Part Two ---

# You notice a second question on the back of the homework assignment:

# What is the largest magnitude you can get from adding only two of the
# snailfish numbers?

# Note that snailfish addition is not commutative - that is, x + y and y + x can
# produce different results.

# Again considering the last example homework assignment above:

# [[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
# [[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]
# [6,[[[6,2],[5,6]],[[7,6],[4,7]]]]
# [[[6,[0,7]],[0,9]],[4,[9,[9,0]]]]
# [[[7,[6,4]],[3,[1,3]]],[[[5,5],1],9]]
# [[6,[[7,3],[3,2]]],[[[3,8],[5,7]],4]]
# [[[[5,4],[7,7]],8],[[8,3],8]]
# [[9,3],[[9,9],[6,[4,9]]]]
# [[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
# [[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]

# The largest magnitude of the sum of any two snailfish numbers in this list is
# 3993. This is the magnitude of [[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]] +
# [[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]], which reduces to
# [[[[7,8],[6,6]],[[6,0],[7,7]]],[[[7,8],[8,8]],[[7,9],[0,6]]]].

# What is the largest magnitude of any sum of two different snailfish numbers
# from the homework assignment?
